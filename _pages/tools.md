The CUWALID system includes multiple tools to assist with both **creating inputs** and **analysing outputs**. Below, you will find two essential tools designed to make working with CUWALID more accessible.

### Input Helper  

A **web-based tool** designed to simplify the creation of JSON inputs for CUWALID models. Instead of manually writing input files, this tool provides an easy-to-use interface that ensures correctness and reduces errors.  

**Key Features:**  
- Select the CUWALID model you need input for  
- Fill out a structured form with required parameters  
- Preview and export the JSON file instantly  
- Upload an existing JSON to modify inputs

### CUWALID App

A **PC-based application** designed to help users **run the DRYP model**, **visualize CUWALID outputs** and perform **common analysis tasks** without needing coding experience.   

Currently the system can plot:
- Run the **DRYP** model
- Plot **Netcdf** 2d and 3d (time), **time-series csv data** and **raster** files
- **Extract data** based on regions and points (decided by shape files and csv files respectively)
