The CUWALID system includes multiple tools to assist with both **creating inputs** and **analysing outputs**. Below, you will find two essential tools designed to make working with CUWALID more accessible.

### Input Helper  
A **web-based tool** designed to simplify the creation of JSON inputs for CUWALID models. Instead of manually writing input files, this tool provides an easy-to-use interface that ensures correctness and reduces errors.  

**Key Features:**  
- Select the CUWALID model you need input for  
- Fill out a structured form with required parameters  
- Preview and export the JSON file instantly  
- Upload an existing JSON to modify inputs

### CUWALID Desktop Application  
A **PC-based application** designed to help users **visualize CUWALID outputs** and perform **common analysis tasks** without needing coding experience.   

Currently the system can plot:
- Shape files
- ASCII files or .asc files
- NetCDF both 2d and 3d (when 3d with time it will add a slider at the bottom of the plot you can use to move through the time steps). It will -    automatically open the first variable in the netcdf but you can change which variable it plots after you have opened it with a dropdown menu on the main screen.
- CSV files (like those provided in the output you linked me on google drive)
