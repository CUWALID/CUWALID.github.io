## Overview

stoPET is part of the climate component of the CUWALID system. It fills the gap between the climate forecast and the hydrological forecast by generating potential evapotranspiration, PET, fields required to run the hydrological model.

stoPET generates stochastic realizations of PET at high spatial (0.1 degrees) and temporal resolution (1 hour). These PET values are generated based on historical values from the global hourly potential evapotranspiration dataset, hPET.
