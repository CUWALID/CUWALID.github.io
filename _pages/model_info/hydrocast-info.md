## Overview
HydroCast is the core component of the water forecast system. It processes and translates the ensemble hydrological simulations into probabilistic forecasts.

HydroCast also postprocess the historical simulations to create all necesary parameters required to prepare the probabilistic forecast.

HydroCast uses a tercile approach for the probabilistic forecasting based on historical simulations.
