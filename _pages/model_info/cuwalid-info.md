## Overview
The CUWALID climate and hydrological forecasting system is a modelling system that integrates climate stochastic generators and  hydrological model DRYP within a tercile forecasting framework. The main goal of CUWALID is to translate climatological forecast into a water status forecast that can be used by stake holders and decision makers.

CUWALID components include stoPET, STORM, DRYP, and the WaterCast component, which includes HydroCast and ImCast. CUWALID first creates an ensemble of hydrological simulations which is the postproccessed within the WaterCast component.
