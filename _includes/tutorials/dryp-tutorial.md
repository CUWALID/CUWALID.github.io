## DRYP Tutorial

<a href="/model-info/#dryp-model" class="btn btn--primary">Model Information</a>

### Overview

We have prepared a series of tutorials to help users learn how to develop a hydrological model using DRYP. These tutorials include examples of models designed to enhance understanding of all model components and demonstrate the capabilities of DRYP. We use synthetic examples to introduce the model's features and guide users through its functionalities.

The training materials are presented as a series of Jupyter Notebooks, which will help you navigate the content and run DRYP efficiently.

The user can find and download all training materials as well as DRYP model examples from the following GitHub repo [CUWALID-tutorials](https://github.com/AndresQuichimbo/CUWALID-tutorials/):

DRYP model examples can be downloaded from:

### Training Modules
The training materials are divided into two main modules:

* Introduction to DRYP and the Model Gridded Environment

* Development of a Basin-Scale Model Using Regional Datasets

##### Module 1: Understanding the Hydrological Model DRYP
This module is designed to help users understand the key features and components of the DRYP hydrological model. It includes theoretical explanations as well as hands-on examples using synthetic experiments to demonstrate model behavior.

Sections in this module:

1. Introduction to the DRYP Python Library – [Intro](https://github.com/AndresQuichimbo/CUWALID-tutorials/blob/main/Training/DRYP/intro_modelling/01_DRYP_intro.ipynb)

2. Understanding DRYP and the Model Grid Environment – [Model environment](https://github.com/AndresQuichimbo/CUWALID-tutorials/blob/main/Training/DRYP/intro_modelling/02_DRYP_model_development.ipynb)

3. Exploring DRYP Through Synthetic Experiments – [Model Examples](https://github.com/AndresQuichimbo/CUWALID-tutorials/blob/main/Training/DRYP/intro_modelling/03_DRYP_test_models.ipynb)

#### Module 2: Developing a Basin-Scale Model Using Regional Datasets
This module guides users through the process of building a catchment-scale hydrological model using real-world regional datasets. Users will learn how to prepare model input parameters using the built-in CUWALID tools, which support the preprocessing and processing of gridded and raster data.

Sections in this module:

1. Preparing Model Input Parameters and Datasets – [DRYP pre-processing](https://github.com/AndresQuichimbo/CUWALID-tutorials/blob/main/Training/DRYP/catchment/02_DRYP_pre_processing.ipynb).

2. Running a Catchment-Scale DRYP Model – [Running simulations](https://github.com/AndresQuichimbo/CUWALID-tutorials/blob/main/Training/DRYP/catchment/DRYP_model_running.ipynb)

3. Post-processing DRYP Model Outputs – [DRYP post-processing](https://github.com/AndresQuichimbo/CUWALID-tutorials/blob/main/Training/DRYP/catchment/04_DRYP_post_processing.ipynb)
