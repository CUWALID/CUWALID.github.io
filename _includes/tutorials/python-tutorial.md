## Python Tutorial

This section provides recommendations for learning Python, especially if you're new to coding. The tutorials listed here are **not affiliated** with the CUWALID Team but are **free online resources** we highly recommend.  

### Downloading Python

The easiest way to start with Python is by using **Anaconda**, a platform that simplifies installation, environment management, and package dependencies (which is essential for CUWALID). We **strongly recommend** using Anaconda to create environments with specific python versions and using `pip` to install dependencies as described [here](/tutorials/#pip-installation).
