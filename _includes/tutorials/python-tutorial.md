## Python Tutorial

This section provides recommendations for learning Python, especially if you're new to coding. The tutorials listed here are **not affiliated** with the CUWALID Team but are **free online resources** we highly recommend.  

### Downloading Python

The easiest way to start with Python is by using **Anaconda**, a platform that simplifies installation, environment management, and package dependencies (which is essential for CUWALID). We **strongly recommend** using Anaconda to create environments with specific python versions and using `pip` to install dependencies as described [here](/tutorials/#pip-installation).

### CUWALID Python Help

CUWALID uses well known packages to handle information and performed calculations, so, you will find the following packages useful for preparing model parameters as well as analysis model outputs. Here, you also find links to widely used, **free resources** available online. Below are some recommended tutorials (not affiliated with CUWALID):  

- **[Handling time series with pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/09_timeseries.html)** – Pandas is a very powerful package to manage all kind of tabular data including time series (e.g. *.csv). The later is one of the common CUWALID output formats. In this ling you will find how to create and manage time series and tabular datasets.

- **[Create netCDF files with xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/user-guide/data-structures.html)** – Here you will find information to create, open, and process netCDF files, the mos common formats used in climatological sciences and widely used in CUWALID. 

- **[Visualising model ouputs with xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/user-guide/plotting.html)** – Plotiing netCDF datasets, common gridded dataset format for CUWALID outputs. 

- **[Handling raster dataset with rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/reading.html)** – You can use rasterio to create raster files (e.g. *.ASC, *.tif) which are the common gridded format for CUWALID model parameters.
